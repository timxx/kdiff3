Building:
Via MinGW-compiler package (http://www.mingw.org/): Compile via gnu-make (Makefile)
Via MSVC2005: Use vcproj-file.
Via CMake: config with cmake and build the diff_ext_for_kdiff3 target


Installation:
For basic testing you can run "regsvr32 diff_ext_for_kdiff3.dll".
To use all features the installation that comes with the KDiff3-setup*.exe is recommended.
See also the nsi-file available on the KDiff3-subversion-repository:
http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/kdiff3/trunk/kdiff3/windows_installer/kdiff3.nsi


Translation:
If you would like help translating diff-ext-for-kdiff3 please copy the diff_ext.pot to
diff_ext_xx.po (where xx is the language-shortcut).
Then edit that file and fill in the msgstr-string for each respective msgid-string.
Then place the for in the KDiff3-translations subdirectory.
Use the language selection within KDiff3 to switch the language or set the language shortcut
in the registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\KDiff3\diff-ext: Language
If everything works, please send me the created file.


Have fun,
Joachim
